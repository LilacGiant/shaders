A shader I put together to use in vrchat worlds.

### Improvements over standard:

- geometric specular antialiasing
- bicubic lightmap interpolation
- directional lightmap specular
- bakery sh,rnm and specular
- better parallax
- anisotropy
- dithered lod crossfade
- audio link emission
- detail and mask map based on hdrp/lit
- shader lock in optimizer

some features from standard might be missing currently, optimizer might have bugs, back up your projects
